### üß© Decorators

Decorators in Python are a powerful tool that allow you to modify or enhance the behavior of functions or classes without changing their actual implementation. They are widely used in web frameworks, logging, access control, and more.

In this directory, you will learn:

- **Basic decorator syntax**: How to define and apply simple decorators using the `@` symbol.
- **Parameterized decorators**: Creating decorators that accept arguments.
- **`functools.wraps`**: Preserving function metadata when writing decorators.
- **Practical examples**:
  - Logging function calls
  - Authentication and access control
  - Measuring execution time of functions

By mastering decorators, you'll write cleaner, more modular, and reusable code.
