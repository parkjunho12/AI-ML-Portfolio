### 📊 NumPy & Pandas

NumPy and Pandas are the foundation of data science in Python. NumPy offers efficient array computations, while Pandas provides high-level data manipulation capabilities.

This directory includes:

- **NumPy fundamentals**:
  - Array creation, slicing, indexing
  - Broadcasting and vectorized operations
  - Mathematical and statistical operations
- **Pandas essentials**:
  - Creating Series and DataFrames
  - Indexing, selecting, and filtering data
  - Aggregations, groupby operations, and pivot tables
  - Handling missing values and data cleaning
  - Reading from and writing to CSV, Excel, and JSON files

You’ll use real-world datasets to practice manipulating and analyzing data efficiently.
